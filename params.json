The Montreal Forced Aligner will work on any dataset that is sufficiently large and can be used with any language for which you have a pronunciation dictionary. Single recordings and smaller datasets can be aligned using either pre-trained models included in the command line utility, or models that you have trained yourself from larger data.\r\n\r\nThe underlying technology is the Kaldi ASR toolkit (http://kaldi-asr.org/).  Installing and using the Montreal Forced Aligner executables requires no prerequisites or compilation of third party toolkits (such as HTK).  Further information is available on the project's documentation (http://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io).\r\n\r\n### Executable downloads\r\n\r\nPlease visit the release page (https://github.com/MontrealCorpusTools/Montreal-Forced-Aligner/releases) and download the latest release.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n* Michael McAuliffe (@mmcauliffe, michael.e.mcauliffe@gmail.com)\r\n* Michaela Socolof (@michaelasocolof)\r\n* Sarah Mihuc (@samihuc)\r\n* Michael Wagner (@prosodylab)\r\n\r\n### Citation\r\n\r\nMcAuliffe, Michael, Michaela Socolof, Sarah Mihuc, and Michael Wagner (2016).
